# BigDataTechnology-CSE522
Spark Kafka Streaming Hbase Project

There are a total of three small projects of my Big Data Technology Course, CSE 522

1. Spark Streaming : 
I will show how to build a simple application that reads online streams from Twitter using Python, then 
processes the tweets using Apache Spark Streaming to identify hashtags.

2. KafkaSparkHive Integration:
▪ create a stream of tweets that will be sent to a Kafka queue
▪ pull the tweets from the Kafka cluster
▪ calculate the character count and word count for each tweet
▪ save this data to a Hive table

3. Research Project: 
Spark ML project.
